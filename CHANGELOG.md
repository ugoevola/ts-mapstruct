# [3.0.0](https://github.com/ugoevola/ts-mapstruct/releases/tag/v3.0.0)
### Breaking Changed
- The **@Mappings** decorator doesn't work without **@Mapper** on the parent class
### Added
- The ability to force the type of a targeted property
- The ability to target a targeted property in depth
- Implicit Mapping for more than one parameter
- Reinforcement of the tests
### Changed
- Before the script auto-generated by **@Mappings** did heavy calculations, like selecting the right **@BeforeMapping** or **@AfterMapping** methods before executing them. So when a method was called, the computation time varied depending on the amount of methods inside the mapper.<br>
Now, all the selection calculations are done when the mapper is instantiated, and the auto-generated mapping method does the minimum.
- Adding of one provided mapping method: **getOrEmptyString**
- Review of returned exceptions
### Fixed
- The getConcatProperies without a seprator doesn't work well, so now the separtor must be filled in.
# [2.0.3](https://github.com/ugoevola/ts-mapstruct/releases/tag/v2.0.3)
> **NOTE**: This version is deprecated.
### Changed
- more scalable code with linter and jest tests
### Fixed
- getConcatProperties couldn't be used
- parameters with underscors are now recognized
